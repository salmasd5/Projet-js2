                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standardized system for marking up text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages. HTML allows authors to structure their content, format it semantically, and specify how it should be displayed in a web browser. It consists of a series of elements, or tags, that are used to describe the content and structure of a webpage. When a web browser reads an HTML file, it converts the tags into visual elements that are displayed on the screen. HTML is used to create and structure content on the internet and is the foundation of most websites.</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. CSS is used to control the style of a web document in a simple and easy way. It can be used to style documents written in HTML, XML, and other markup languages. With CSS, you can specify things like the font, color, and size of text, the spacing between elements, the background color and image of an element, and much more. You can use CSS to style both the content and layout of a webpage.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web development. It is a client-side scripting language, which means that it is executed by the web browser on the user's computer, rather than on the server. JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites, such as form validation, image sliders, and drop-down menus. It is also often used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, which is a representation of the structure of a web page in the browser's memory.</p>

                <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming language that is widely used for web development. It is a server-side scripting language, which means that it is executed on the server rather than in the browser. PHP is used to create dynamic web pages, which means that the content of the page can change based on user input or other variables. It is often used in combination with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and user-friendly websites. PHP is also used to interact with databases, allowing for the storage and retrieval of data such as user information and product lists.</p>
